        <h1>An in depth tour of the language</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>[Language name] is a lojban-inspired language aimed at try to change some
            aspects of it which may be seen as drawbacks, while also experimenting with
            new ideas.
        </p>

        <p>One of the key aspect of the language is to manipulate only relations
            and predicates. Relations describes the interaction between some
            entities, while a predicate assert the relation between the provided
            entities being true.

        <h3>Relations and predicates</h3>

        <p>
            The language is made of 2 kinds of things : relation and predicates.
            Relations describes the interaction between some entities, while a
            predicate asserts the relation between the provided entities is true.

            In the english sentence "I eat an apple", there is
            the relation of "eating", with the subject being "I" and the thing being
            eaten is "an apple". In english this is done by having a subject,
            a complement and sometimes the use of prepositions.

            In this language, relations definitions describes a "place structure"
            with numbered places. By filling those places, assertions can be made.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>cti'a fa mi fe plie</em></p>
            <p>I eat an apple</p>
        </blockquote>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>cti'a</dt>
            <dd>x1 eats x2</dd>

            <dt>fa</dt>
            <dd>tags 1st predicate place</dd>

            <dt>mi</dt>
            <dd>x1 is the speaker(s)</dd>

            <dt>fe</dt>
            <dd>tags 2st predicate place</dd>

            <dt>plie</dt>
            <dd>x1 is an apple of species/strain x2</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            <b>cti'a</b> is a relation word meaning "<em>x1 eats x2</em>".
            In this definition, <b>x1</b> represents the place of
            <em>the one who eats</em>, while <b>x2</b> represents the place of <em>what is eaten</em>.
            <b>fa</b> and <b>fe</b> are particles which tags respectively
            the 1st and 2nd place, and both are followed by the thing which fills them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The things filling the places are themselves relations. When a relation fills a place,
            the concept expressed by its <b>1st</b> place is used. For <b>mi</b> it is
            "<em>I, the speaker</em>" while with <b>plie</b> it is "<em>an apple</em>".
            It is thus "<em>I, the speaker</em>" who eats, and "<em>an apple</em>" which
            is eaten.
