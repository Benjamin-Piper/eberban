        <h1>An in depth tour of eberban</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p><em>eberban</em> is a lojban-inspired language aimed at try to change some
            aspects of it which may be seen as drawbacks, while also experimenting with
            new ideas.
        </p>

        <p>One of the key aspect of the language is to manipulate only predicates
            and propositions. Predicates describes the interaction between some
            entities, while a proposition assert the predicate between the provided
            entities being true.

        <h3>Predicates and propositions</h3>

        <p>
            The language is made of 2 kinds of things : predicate and propositions.
            Predicates describes the interaction between some entities, while a
            proposition asserts the predicate between the provided entities is true.

            In the english sentence "I eat an apple", there is
            the predicate of "eating", with the subject being "I" and the thing being
            eaten is "an apple". This is done by having a subject,
            a complement and sometimes the use of prepositions.

            In this language, predicates definitions describes a "place structure"
            with numbered places. By filling those places, assertions can be made.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>cti'a fa mi fe plie</em></p>
            <p>I eat an apple</p>
        </blockquote>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>cti'a</dt>
            <dd>x1 eats x2</dd>

            <dt>fa</dt>
            <dd>tags 1st proposition place</dd>

            <dt>mi</dt>
            <dd>x1 is the speaker(s)</dd>

            <dt>fe</dt>
            <dd>tags 2st proposition place</dd>

            <dt>plie</dt>
            <dd>x1 is an apple of species/strain x2</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            <b>cti'a</b> is a predicate word meaning "<em>x1 eats x2</em>".
            In this definition, <b>x1</b> represents the place of
            <em>the one who eats</em>, while <b>x2</b> represents the place of <em>what is eaten</em>.
            <b>fa</b> and <b>fe</b> are particles which tags respectively
            the 1st and 2nd place, and both are followed by the thing which fills them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The things filling the places are themselves predicates. When a predicate fills a place,
            the concept expressed by its <b>1st</b> place is used. For <b>mi</b> it is
            "<em>I, the speaker</em>" while with <b>plie</b> it is "<em>an apple</em>".
            It is thus "<em>I, the speaker</em>" who eats, and "<em>an apple</em>" which
            is eaten.
