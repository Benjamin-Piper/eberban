  gloss: symbol
  short: "[E:ma] is a symbol."
  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜe ‚ä§ is-symbol(e)
  notes: |
    Simplest non-predicate type. All more complex non-predicate types are
    symbols that must additionally satisfy some properties.

    There are an infinite amount of symbol which have no intrinsic meaning.
    Instead we can spawn some and declare that they are connected in some way
    using definitions.

    Can also be used alone for tautology (always true).
mai:
  family: "MI"
  gloss: "exists"
  short: "[E:a] exists."
  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜe ‚ä§
  notes:
    Binding the [E] place multiple time allows to express equality/equivalence.

  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜE ùúÜA ‚àÄx ‚àÄy ... E(c,x,y,...) ‚áí A(c,x,y,...)
  notes: |
    [E] can be used to represent tuples or arguments that satisfy [A].
    This can be used to express indirect questions, with [A] being a predicate
    acting as a question and [E] representing the indirect
    question/answer to the question.

  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜE E(c,c)

    an explicit parameter. Allows to handle the context like any other argument.

  gloss: "[name]"
  note: |
    Another place can be selected by adding a SE particle between {zai} and the

zu:
  family: "ZI"
  short: |
    Transform an [A:()] place into an [A:(a)] place, which is provided the
    content of the [E:a] place.  
    The resulting predicate is transitive.

    While a SE before {zu} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after
    {zu} allow to select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select
    the proposition place. Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit
    {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't
    make sense to use the same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place will be the one being transitioned to in
    chaining (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zu}).

    Each member is provided to [A] wrapped in a singleton set to make any predicate

    See {tcei} for the unwrapped variant, which is mainly required to deal with

    When {tce} is used in places annotations, it is usually used either
    distributively or collectively. Distributively means that if the predicate
    is true then it is true for any subset of such distributive place, which is
    not necessarily the case with collective behavior. As this distinction
    is important for the meaning of such predicates, distributive are marked
    as {tce}*.

  notes: |
    Each proposition of [O] will be evaluated with a context optained from the

    replaced like so:
    - In the first proposition [@zai ekcate](x) is true only if x = [E].
    - For all other propositions [@zai ekcate] is equal to the previous
      proposition [@zai ekcata].
    - In the last proposition [@zai ekcata](x) is true only if x = [A].

    Predicates {kcan}, {kco} and {kcu} interact with [@zai ekcate] and
    [@zai ekcata] to provide ergonomic transformations.

kcan:
  family: "R"
  gloss: map-transform-delete
