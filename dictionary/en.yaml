    Transform an (A-P0)/[A-P0] place into an [A-P1] place, which is provided the content of the (E) place.  
    Notice that [A-P1] is now a switching place (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zu}).

    While a SE before {zu} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after {zu} allow to
    select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select the proposition place.
    Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't make sense to use the
    same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place is made into a switching place (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zu}).
