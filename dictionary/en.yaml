  short: "[E:ma] is an atom (grammar)"
  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜe is-atom(e)
  notes: |
    Simplest non-predicate type. All more complex non-predicate types are
    symbols that must additionally satisfy some properties.

    There are an infinite amount of symbol which have no intrinsic meaning.
    Instead we can spawn some and declare that they are connected in some way
    using definitions.

    Can also be used alone for tautology (always true).
mai:

  short: "[E:a] exists."
  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜe ‚ä§
  notes:
    Binding the [E] place multiple time allows to express equality/equivalence.

  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜE ùúÜA ‚àÄx ‚àÄy ... E(c,x,y,...) ‚áí A(c,x,y,...)
  notes: |
    [E] can be used to represent tuples or arguments that satisfy [A].
    This can be used to express indirect questions, with [A] being a predicate
    acting as a question and [E] representing the indirect
    question/answer to the question.

zu:
  id: QrPQJlBXO6

  gloss: "#()-to-(a)"
  tags: [core]
  short: |
    Transform an [A:()] place into an [A:(a)] place, which is provided the
    content of the [E:a] place.  
    The resulting predicate is transitive.

    While a SE before {zu} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after
    {zu} allow to select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select
    the proposition place. Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit
    {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't
    make sense to use the same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place will be the one being transitioned to in
    chaining (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zu}).

  notes: |
    Creates a predicate stating the argument is some specific and fixed atom or
    generic value. The predicate thus have type (a).

    Using it before words other than KI make them behave like KI variables. It
    can thus be used to define freeform predicate variables (i-) to refer to
    an atom.
boi:
  id: AEGuXusum3
  family: "BO"
  gloss: "#new-var-pred"
  short: "Create a new general predicate variable and discard previous value if any."
  notes: |
    This predicate can have arbitrary arguments, which will be constrainted by
    the rest of the sentence.

    When used before KI, have the same meaning as {bo} as all KI are expected
    to have type (a).
