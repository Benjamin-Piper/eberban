zu:

    Transform an (A-P0)/[A-P0] place into an [A-P1] place, which is provided the content of the (E) place.  
    Notice that [A-P1] is now a switching place (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zu}).

    While a SE before {zu} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after {zu} allow to
    select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select the proposition place.
    Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't make sense to use the
    same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place is made into a switching place (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zu}).

bin:
  family: "R"
  gloss: symbol
  short: "[E:bin] is a symbol."
  definition: 𝜆c 𝜆e ⊤
  notes: |
    Simplest non-predicate type. All more complex non-predicate types are
    symbols that must additionally satisfy some properties.

    There are an infinity amount of symbol which have no intrinsic meaning.
    Instead we can spawn some and declare that they are connected in some way
    using definitions.
tin:
  family: "R"
  gloss: set-member
  tags: [struct, set]
  short: "A> [E:bin] is a member of set represented by [A:tun]."
ten:
  family: "R"
  gloss: set-some
  tags: [struct, set]
  short: "A> [E:tun] is a set of some symbols that satisfies property [A:(bin)]."
  notes: |
    All symbols in [E] satisfies property [A]. However, not every symbol
    that satisfies [A] is necessarily a member of set [E].

    Is is useful for multiple purposes :
    - In predicate definitions, it can be used to declare a place of some set
      (as a symbol) of things satisfying a property. For exemple, the type
      `cmahe penri` is a set of entities ({penri}).
    - It can be used with {cmahi} to define a property X that will only be
      true if the provided symbol of part of a set S, which itself is defined
      as a set of symbols (not all) that satisfy another property Y. Both the
      set symbol S and it's a associated property X are never explicitely
      defined.
    - Both those usages allows to transform freely between properties (over
      symbols) and symbols, which have different behaviors in eberban grammar.
tan:
  family: "R"
  gloss: singleton
  tags: [struct, set]

    A> [E:tun] represents a set of at least 2 things that satisfies

tun:
  family: "R"
  gloss: set
  tags: [struct, set]
  short: |
    A> [E:bin] represents a set of all symbols that satisfies
    property [A:(bin)].
  notes: |
    All members of set [E] satisfies property [A], and all symbols that satisfy [A]
    are members of set [E]. There is a one to one mapping between [E] and [A] :
    For every [E] there is only one [A], and for every [A] there is only one [E].

    See {ton} for more advanced usage.

    All members of set (E) satisfies property [A], and all symbols that satisfy [A]
    are members of set (E). There is a one to one mapping between (E) and [A] :
    For every (E) there is only one [A], and for every [A] there is only one (E).

    See {cmahe} for more advanced usage.
cmahe:
  family: "R"
  gloss: set-some
  short: "[E:bin] is a set of some symbols that satisfies property ![A:(bin)]."
  notes: |
    All symbols in (E) satisfies property [A]. However, not every symbol
    that satisfies [A] is necessarily a member of set (E).

    Is is useful for multiple purposes :
    - In predicate definitions, it can be used to declare a place of some set
      (as a symbol) of things satisfying a property. For exemple, the type
      `cmahe penri` is a set of entities ({penri}).
    - It can be used with {cmahi} to define a property X that will only be
      true if the provided symbol of part of a set S, which itself is defined
      as a set of symbols (not all) that satisfy another property Y. Both the
      set symbol S and it's a associated property X are never explicitely
      defined.
    - Both those usages allows to transform freely between properties (over
      symbols) and symbols, which have different behaviors in eberban grammar.
