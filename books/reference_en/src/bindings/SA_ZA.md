# Unit transformations (SA/ZA/BA)

## SA

**SA** allow to change which is the **left chaining place** of the following
predicate unit. **say** allows to ask which **SA** should be used to make the
proposition true. Other **SA** allow to use special variables that are related
to the predicate unit. If the predicate unit don't have a bracket place, the
**right chaining place** is also modified.

| say  | SA question : which tag would make the proposition true ? |
| sey  | something related to the predicate (vague transformation) |
| soy  | event of the predicate being true                         |

## ZA

**ZA** allow to change the place structure and/or meaning of the following
predicate unit. Any bindings will be made with the final place structure instead
of the original.

| ze   | Use the same instance and variables of the following unit instead of a new one.                                                                                                                            |
| zi   | Wide-scope negation : negates the predicate and all the followings until the end of the scope with the existential variables they create. It is false that there exist a, e,... such that unit(a, e, ...). |
| zya  | Narrow-scope negation : negates the next predicate unit but not the existential variables it create nor the following units. There is no a, e,... such that unit(a, e, ...).                               |
