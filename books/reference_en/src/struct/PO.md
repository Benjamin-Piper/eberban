# Function declaration (PO)

**po** allows to use a sentence to declare the place structure of a **GA**
variable, a root or a compound. It can be present alongside sentences or
between the optional arguments and the scope of a **PE**-subscope.

> Defining root or compound using PO should only be used when writing
> dictionnaries or when adding vocabulary based on borrowings.

## Exemple

*po ga mian dzo* (We define "ga" as the property of being a black cat.)
*pa mi don tun ga* (I like all things that satisfies "ga".)
