# Function declaration (PO)

**po** allows to use a sentence to declare the place structure of a **GAY**
variable. It can be present alongside sentences or between the optional
arguments and the scope of a **PE**-subscope.

**po** is followed by a single **GAY** particle which will have the described
place structure, followed optionally by an argument list then by a scope.
