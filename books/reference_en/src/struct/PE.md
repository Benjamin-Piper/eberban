# Subscopes (PE)

It is possible to use **PE** with its terminator **PEI** to create a subscope to
have access to all grammar available when making a proposition. **PE** and
**PEI** acts as some sort of opening and closing parenthesis. This subscope acts
as **one predicate unit**.

**PEI** is ellidible if its at the end of a sentence (before **PA**).

A **PE** clause can only contain one complete proposition/predicate. However,
multiple statements with [logical connectives (DA)](./DA.md) are allowed.

> Subscopes makes sentences more complex to understand, and spliting it in
> mulitple simpler sentences might be clearer.
