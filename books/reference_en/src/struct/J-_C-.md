# Free modifiers (J-/C-)

Free modifiers allow to add information to almost anything. Modifier attached to
grammatical starters or terminators apply to the whole object they define.

## Subscript [JA]

**ja** attaches a number or letter string to a word. It can be used to be more
precise when using a vague particle or use more variables.

## Free scopes [JE/JEI]

**je** and **jei** allows to attach information to a group of words which isn't
a single grammatical unit for the grammar (hense "free" scope).

The parser currently doesn't check that each **je** comes with its paired
**jei**.

## Parenthetical note [JO/JOI]

**jo** and it's terminator **joi** allow to add a parenthetical note. This note
can be any valid eberban text.
