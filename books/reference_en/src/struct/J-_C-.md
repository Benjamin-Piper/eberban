# Free modifiers (J-/C-)

> This part is outdated and need to be reworked.

Free modifiers allow to add information to almost anything. Modifier attached to
grammatical starters or terminators apply to the whole object they define.

## Subscript [JA]

**ja** attaches a number or letter string to a word. It can be used to be more
precise when using a vague particle or use more variables.

## Free scopes [JE/JEI]

**je** and **jei** allows to attach information to a group of words which isn't
a single grammatical unit for the grammar (hense "free" scope).

The parser currently doesn't check that each **je** comes with its paired
**jei**.

## Parenthetical note [JO/JOI]

**jo** and it's terminator **joi** allow to add a parenthetical note. This note
can be any valid eberban text.
