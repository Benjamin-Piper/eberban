# Compounds (C)

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical. Complex
concepts are often built upon multiple more primitive concepts, and compounds
are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow transforming any string of valid eberban words (particles, roots
or even borrowings) into a single unit, **ignoring their grammatical rules** but
keeping (to a certain extent) their meaning.

A compound is first prefixed by the particles **a, e, i**, respectively starting a
compound composed of 1, 2, or 3 words. If a compound is made of more than 3
words, it must be prefixed and suffixed by **o**.

> Note : it's totally valid to have a *o-compound* with less than 4 words,
> however using a/e/i is prefered. They're equivalent and have the same meaning,
> and only the canonical (shorter one) will be listed in the dictionary.

If the first word starts with **u** (a borrowing) then the pause before this
**u** is optional.

A compound have a **unique, fixed meaning which is defined in the dictionary**,
and while its place structure can be arbitrary, it usually provides places taken
from its individual components. Usually the most important word is the rightmost
one, and additional words are added to the left to help narrow down the meaning,
yielding greater precision.

1-word compounds are also used to make predicate words corresponding to the rule
of a particle.

## Examples

### apu
`(A) is a paragraph composed of sentence(s) (E).`

- **pu** is the particle to start a paragraph (explaned later in the book)

### eberban

- **ber :** `(A) reflects this language (eberban).`

### igruntceijno
`(A) is a jungle.`

- **grun :** `(A) is wild/untamed.`
- **tcei :** `(A) is a tree.`

### eufrans'ban
`(A) (quote) is expressed in the French language (E).`
