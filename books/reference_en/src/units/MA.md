# Intrinsic variables (MA)

Intrinsic variables (**MA** family) are particles providing predicates about the
discourse itself. All particles starting with **m** are member of **MA**.

### Pronouns

Pronouns are expressed with the following particles :

| Word | Definition                                           |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| mi   | `(A) is I/a speaker/author.`                         |
| mo   | `(A) is you, a listener.`                            |
| moi  | `(A) is someone, neither a speaker or listener.`     |
| mohi | `(A) is this here, near a speaker.`                  |
| moho | `(A) is that here, near a listener.`                 |
| mohu | `(A) is that yonder, far from speaker and listener.` |

## Propositions

It is often useful to refer to other propositions.

| Word | Definition                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mua  | the last proposition                                                |
| mue  | the proposition in which this one is embeded (used in abstractions) |
| mui  | current proposition                                                 |
| muo  | the next proposition (infered from context, usually the next)       |

Counting takes only into account complete proposition, and ignore proposition
that are currently being defined when the word is used.

Using [subscripts **DI**](../struct/DA_DI_DO_DU.md) allow to refer to more distant
predicates.

## Specials

| Word | Definition                                                      |
