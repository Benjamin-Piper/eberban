# Writing systems

As presented in morphology chapter Eberban can be written using the latin
alphabet. However there is also a custom writing system taking advantage
of words morphology which is usable in a __linear form__ similar to how
text is written in latin alphabet or pronounced, and in a __planar form__
which replaces argument binding particles like __VI, FI or SI__ by graphical
2D notation.
