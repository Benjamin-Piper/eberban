# Introduction

**eberban** is a lojban-inspired language aimed as being simple, regular and expressive.

- Simple : eberban is only made of predicates which are manipulated with particles, with few grammar rules.
- Regular : particles are organised into families with a unique prefix, allowing to quickly recognise them.
- Expressive : predicates can be combined in multiple ways to add more details.

This book will provide a detailed tour of the language, covering its concepts and grammar.
