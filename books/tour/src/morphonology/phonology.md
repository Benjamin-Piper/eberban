The word boundary marker __'__ is usually realized as a pause. However before a
vowel-initial word (borrowings, freeform variables and compounds) it can be
realized as a glotal stop \[ʔ\] instead.

Consecutive vowels are separated by hiatuses, but glides like \[j\] and \[w\]
are allowed respectively alongside or instead of \[i\] and \[u\].

Where spaces are allowed, a speaker or writter can express hesitation by using
one or more of the letter __n__ surrounded by spaces, which is realized as \[n̩\].

In speech, the schwa sound \[ə\] can be used in between consonants of a pair if
the speaker has trouble uttering the pair as-is. It has no written equivalent.
