# Pairs

Another important building block is the ability to construct more complex
objects from simple ones. For that we define the concept of a pair, which is an
atom that is associated with a left and right component. We'll use an axiom to
state that there exist an unique atom for every possible pair of left and right
components.

> kin: `[E:ma]` is a pair made of left component `[A:a]` and right component `[O:o]`.`
>
> ```
> po e kin pi be
> ma vai bo kin ...
> ```
>
> For every left and right components __ka__ and __ko__
>
> ```
> fai mae ve ka be
> mae ve ko be ...
> ```
>
> There exist an atom __ki__ which is a pair of __ka__ and __ko__.
>
> ```
> ma vai ki be
> ki ma kin va ka fo ko vai ...
> ```
>
> And it is false that there exist a different atom than __ki__ which is also a
> pair of __ka__ and __ko__ (thus there is a unique symbol for each pair)
>
> ```
> fai bi ma
> ve bi kie
> fe kin va ka fo ko ...
> ```
>
> We consider this an axiom.
> 
> ```
> pi e kin pi
> ```

By convention we'll prefer nesting pairs only in the right component.

Pairs can be used with left atom component specific to a concept A to make
it distinct from object related to concept B that would share the same kind
of objects. Without the left atom used as an identifier some things related
to concept A might also be considered valid things of concept B while it might
not be wanted. Identifiers are often made using __zai__ which will be defined
in the next chapter, and are defined themselves using pairs.
