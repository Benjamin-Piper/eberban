# Identifiers

Identifiers are the names themselves, and corresponds the atom predicated by
the particle __zai__. Since names corresponds to a property, we can define
them like to using pairs, where the left component is an atom representing
the concept of identifiers, and the right component is the property.

> ezaipe: `[E:ma]` is an identifier/name made from property `[A:(a)`.

> ```
> po ezaipe ke gi be ...

We can thus define the grammar `zai <predicate>` as being equivalent to
`pe se ezaipe via <predicate> pei`.
