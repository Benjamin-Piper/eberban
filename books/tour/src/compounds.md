# Compounds [C]

Providing a root for every concept is impossible but also very impractical.
Complex concepts are often based on multiple more basic concepts, and compounds
are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow to transform any string of valid eberban words into a single
unit, ignoring their grammatical rules but keeping their meaning.

A compound is first prefixed by *a, e, i, o* particles, respectively
starting a compound composed of 1, 2, 3, 4. If a compound is made of more than
4 words, it must be prefixed by *u* and suffixed with `.u`.

Spaces are forbidden between the components of the compound.

A compound have a unique meaning which is defined in the dictionnary, and
while it's place structure can be arbitrary, it usualy provide places taken
from its components. Usually the most important word is the rightmost one,
while words are added to the left to add precisions.

1-word compounds are also used to make predicate words corresponding to the
rule of a particle.
