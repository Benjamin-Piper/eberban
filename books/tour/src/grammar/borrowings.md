# Borrowings (u-)

Borrowings allow importing words from other languages which would be difficult
or even impossible to translate using root words, such as proper names,
names of species, and some cultural concepts eberban avoids including
in its roots to be more culturally neutral.

Borrowings start with the letter __u__, followed by the borrowed word written
in the phonology and morphology allowed by eberban while trying to stay
close to the original pronounciation.

If the borrowed word starts with __u__ then the prefix used is __u'__ to avoid
2 consecutive _u_.

A chain of multiple borrowings will count as only one predicate composed of
multiple parts. To prevent 2 borrowings to fusing into one predicate, you can
separate them with the particle __be__ (__be__ can optionally appear after
every borrowing group but is only necessary when separating multiple groups).

Its meaning is not defined in eberban, and its truth value is always undefined.
It can be used to import foreign words that interlocutors will collectively
understand, but using non-borrowings is always prefered if possible.
Borrowings can have any number of places, and since it is not defined in eberban
each place is considered to be generic place (no type inference can be
performed). Chaining will always consider it is a generic/atom place (like bound
with ve/va/...), and vie/via/... must be used for predicate equivalence
bindings.

Like roots and compounds, borrowings are transitive if they end with a vowel,
while they are intransitive if they end with a consonant (not only sonorants).

Borrowing can be used to import proper nouns by prefixing them with particle
__za__, which gives it the meaning `[tce* man] is named [borrowed word]` (a
more complete explanation of __za__ will be given a later chapter).

## Example

```gloss
mi za umia uentropi (be)

mi {za umia uentropi} {(be)}

{E:$(x) is the speaker} {\[E:$(x) is named "mia entropi"\]} {(end of borrowing)}

I am named "mia entropi".
```
