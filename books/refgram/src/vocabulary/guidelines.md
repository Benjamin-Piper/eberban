# Guidelines

To simplify designing and learning groups of words, they are usually designed by following a
pattern like a common prefix. To stay consistent across the whole dictionary those patterns should
follow the following guidelines:

- Vowels IEAOU encode order and scale, from small/negative to big/positive. As final -i encodes
  the type of the transitive place, it should be skipped in final vowel patterns.
- Vowels can encode direction by following the following cross diagram. As A is the loudest vowed
  and the 3rd vowel out of 5, it is used to represent forward. I is used for the center and other
  vowels are placed in counter-clockwise order.
  ```
    A
    |
    |
  O-I-E
    |
    U
  ```
- Vowel patterns should be prefered over sonorant patterns. If sonorant patterns are used they
  should follow the same guidelines with NRL order.
