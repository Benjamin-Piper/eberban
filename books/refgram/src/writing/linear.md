# Linear writing system

The linear writing system is structured around syllables with a vowel written in
the center and the consonants or sonorants being written above or below, forming four corners (up left, up right, down left, down right). 

- If a syllable starts with a sonorant (N-initial particles, or multi-syllables words like
ma-__na__.), it can be written either in the top or bottom left. 
- If a syllable starts with one or two consonants, they must be placed up or down depending if the
  first consonant is unvoiced (up) or voiced (down).
- If a syllable ends with a sonorant and is the last syllable of the word, it must be placed on the
  right and opposite side of the initial consonant or sonorant. If there is no initial it can be
  written either up or down.
- If a syllable ends with a consonant because it is part of a medial pair or triplet, then the first
  consonant must be placed on the opposite side of the initial consonant of the current syllable,
  and the following consonants will be written at the start of the next syllable (following syllable
  start rules). This means that for exemple in `vog-bi`, since initial `v` is written at the bottom
  left, the `g` must be written at the top right, even though it is voiced and thus is usually
  written at the bottom. We know it's a `g` and not a `k` thanks to the following `b` which is
  voiced and thus written at the bottom left. If the syllable doesn't have an initial consonant it
  is adviced to written the ending consonant on its usual side, however it is not mandatory.
- This writting system ignores spaces. Use symbol for pause (`'`) when necessary. In borrowings and
  freeform variables ending with a consonant, it must be written at the start of the pause symbol
  (avoiding the ambiguity of consonants at the end of syllable which is usually resolved thanks to
  the following consonant, while there is none here).
