# Discourse predicates (MI)

Discourse predicates are additional __MI__ particles that don't wrap logical primitives, but are
instead part of __MI__ for historical reasons and are related to the discourse.

__mi__ (intransitive) refers to the speaker(s) in speech, or narrator(s) in writen media, with at
least one of the members being the main speaker/narrator.

__mo__ (intransitive) refers to the listerner(s)/interlocutor(s).

__mio__ (intransitive) refers to a set of individuals which includes at least the main speaker and
at least one of the listener(s)/interlocutor(s), and doesn't include something that is neither a
speaker or listener. It can be seen as an __inclusive we__.

__mie__ (intransitive) on the other hand refers to a set of individuals which includes at least the
main speakers and which can include anything that __is not__ the listener. It can be seen as an
__exclusive we__.

__moe__ (intransitive) refers to a set of individuals which includes neither speakers bor listeners.
It can be seen as __third person pronoun__.

__me__ (intransitive) is something that the speaker(s) particulary have in mind. Corresponds loosely
to *the* or *this* in English.
