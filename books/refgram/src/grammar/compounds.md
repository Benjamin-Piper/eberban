# Compounds (e-)

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical and isn't
great for memorization. Complex concepts are often built upon multiple primitive
concepts, and compounds are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow the transformation of any string of valid Eberban words
(particles, roots and borrowings) into a single unit. While a compound
__ignores the grammatical rules of the individual words__, its meaning should
(to a certain extent) be related.

A compound start with either __e, en, er__, respectively starting a
compound composed of two, three, or more words. er-compounds stop when a single
__e__ is encountered (with a space or word boundary marker before it). Spaces
can be inserted between any of the parts of the compound.

If the first word starts with a vowel (a borrowing or __A/O__ particle) then the
pause before this vowel is optional. __NI__ particles needs to be prefixed by a
pause or space to not be confused with the __en__ start.

Compounds have __unique and fixed meanings which are defined in the
dictionary__, and while the definition of each one can be arbitrary, they
usually provide arguments taken from their individual components. Usually, the
most important word is the rightmost one, and additional words are added to the
left to help narrow down the meaning, yielding greater precision.

It is common to lexicalize a borrowing by making a compound with it. Cultural
concepts are borrowed with endonyms, sounding similar to the original word.

A compound have the same __transitivity__ as its last/rightmost component. If we
want to define a compound with the opposite transitivity, then the initial
__e/en/er__ should be followed by an __i__. If the last component is a particle
that cannot be used as a predicate, it is considered to be intransitive.

> __e ber ban :__ `[tca man] is the eberban language.`
> 
> - ber : `[E:tce* man] reflects this language (eberban).`
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __e uinglic ban :__ `[E:tca ban] is the english language.`
> 
> - uinglic : borrowing of "english".
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __en cen on bu :__ `[E:tce* ma] is a dictionary.`
>
> - cen : `E:tce* man`
> - on : Particle starting a definition.
> - bu : Particle creating lists.
