# Compounds (e-/a-/o-)

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical and isn't
great for memorization. Complex concepts are often built upon multiple more
primitive concepts, and compounds are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow the transformation of any string of valid eberban words
(particles, roots and borrowings) into a single unit, __ignoring their
grammatical rules__ but should keep (to a certain extent) a related meaning.

A compound is first prefixed by the letter __e, a, o__, respectively starting a
compound composed of 2, 3, or more words. O-compounds stop when a new __o__ is
encountered (with a space or word boundary marker before it). Spaces can be
inserted between any of the parts of the compound.

If the first word starts with a vowel (a borrowing) then the pause before this
vowel is optional.

Compounds have __unique and fixed meanings which are defined in the dictionary__,
and while the definition of each one can be arbitrary, they usually provide
places taken from their individual components. Usually, the most important word
is the rightmost one, and additional words are added to the left to help narrow
down the meaning, yielding greater precision.

It is common to lexicalize a borrowing by making a compound with it. Cultural
concepts are borrowed with endonyms, sounding similar to the original word.

A compound follow the same __chaining behavior__ as its last/right-most
component. If we want to define a compound with the opposite chaining behavior,
the initial vowel is followed by an __i__.

> __e ber ban :__ `[tca man] is the eberban language.`
> 
> - ber : `[E:tce* man] reflects this language (eberban).`
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __e uinglic ban :__ `[E:tca ban] is the english language.`
> 
> - uinglic : borrowing of "english".
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __a cen po bu :__ `[E:tce* ma] is a dictionary.`
>
> - cen : `E:tce* man`
> - po : Particle starting a definition.
> - bu : Particle creating lists.
