# Predicate place binding

Predicate places are represented in definitions by using parenthesis, in which
there can be the type and constrant of zero or more arguments.

- `tcu: [E:tcui a] is the set of all things that individualy satisfy [A:(tcai
  a)].`

To define the content of the predicated being provided, __VE__ members __vie,
via, vio, viu__ (and their __FE__ equivalent) can be used, optionally followed
by a list of arguments represented by particles of families __GI__ and __KI__
and ended with particle __be__. __GI__ represents predicate arguments while
__KI__ represent atoms or generic arguments. If the amount of arguments in the
definition does match the amount of arguments of the place are simply ignored.

If no argument list is provided then the places of the first predicate are
automatically bound. It is also possible to omit a __VE__ entirely if you're
chaining into a predicate place (with default transitivity or with a __SE__
particle), however it is not possible to provide an argument list.

The following sentences are all equivalent :

- `tcu [ve buri meon] [fia ke be ke mian]`
- `tcu [ve buri meon] [fia mian]`
- `meon sae buri tcu via mian`
- `meon sae buri tcu mian`

Which means "All cats are eating an apple".

> __GI__ particles all start with _g-_ and can be chosen arbitrarily.
> All __GI__ member starting with __gi-__ have transitive while all others are
> intransitive.
> __KI__ particles all start with _k-_ and can be chosen arbitrarily, and all
> have the same behavior `[E] is the argument X`.

> When binding an atom/generic place it is also possible to use the argument
> list grammar, which corresponds the to atom satisfying the defined (1-ary)
> property.

> In this exemple nothing is said about if all cats are eating the same apple(s).
> Some cats may share the same apple or all cats could eat distinct apples.
