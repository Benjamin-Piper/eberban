# Predicate places

Let's look at the definitions of some eberban words :

- djin: `(Ed) desires/wants/wishes [A0].`
- kre: `(Ed) helps [Ad] to satisfy property (O1).`
- kini: `(Ed) learns/studies fact [A0] about (Od).`
- jvin: `(Ed) dances.`
- eberban: `(Ed) is the eberban language.`

The number next to the uppercase vowel indicates it is a __predicate place__,
the number being the amount of arguments. This number is called the
__arity__ of places and predicates.

``gloss
mi djin mi jvin

mi djin mi jvin

{\[B is me\]} {\[B wants __C__\]}
{C = \[D is me\]} {\[D dances.\]}

I want that \[Me dancing\] is true/occurs. I want to dance.
``

If this number is greater than 0, it will correspond to the places of
the next predicate in order :

``gloss
mi kre va mo fo kini vo eberban

mi kre va mo fo kini vo eberban

{\[B is me\]} {\[B helps C to D\]}
{〈 switch to C} {\[C is you\]}
{switch to D} {D(__F__) = \[__F__ learns G about H\]}
{〈 switch to H} {\[H is eberban\] 〉 〉}

I help you to learn something about eberban.
