# Predicate places

Let's look at the definitions of some eberban words :

- djin: `(Ad) desires/wants/wishes [E0].`
- kre: `(Ad) helps [Ed] to satisfy property (I1).`
- kini: `(Ad) learns/studies fact [E0] about (Id).`
- jvin: `(Ad) dances.`
- eberban: `(Ad) is the eberban language.`

The number next to the uppercase vowel indicates it is a __predicate place__,
the number being the amount of arguments. This number is called the
__arity__ of places and predicates.

``gloss
mi djin mi jvin

me wants me dance

{\[B is me\]} {\[B wants __C__\]}
{C = \[D is me\]} {\[D dances.\]}

I want that \[Me dancing\] is true/occurs. I want to dance.
``

If this number is greater than 0, it will correspond to the places of
the next predicate in order :

``gloss
mi kre ve mo fi kini vi eberban

mi helps {〈 switch-E} you switch-I learn {〈 switch-I} {eberban 〉 〉}

{\[B is me\]} {\[B helps C to D\]}
{〈 switch to C} {\[C is you\]}
{switch to D} {D(__F__) = \[__F__ learns G about H\]}
{〈 switch to H} {\[H is eberban\] 〉 〉}

I help you to learn something about eberban.
