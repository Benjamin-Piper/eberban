# Discourse predicates

The __MA__ particle family contains all particles starting with __m__. They
have the same usage as roots and contains predicates related to the discourse
itself. 

## Pronouns

The following particles are similar to pronouns in other languages :

- __mi :__ `(Ad) is I/a speaker/author.` Remember that individual variables are
  plural and thus could refer to multiple speaker or authors (exclusive we).
- __mo :__ `(Ad) is you, a listener.`
- __mio :__ `(Ad) is I/a speaker/author or you, a listener.` (inclusive we)
- __me :__ `(Ad) is someone, neither a speaker or listener.` Note that using
  __me__ multiple times doesn't imply it is the same person(s). Refering to the
  same person or things will be explained in a later chapter.
- __mei :__ `(Ad) is this here, near a speaker.`
- __meo :__ `(Ad) is that here, near a listener.`
- __meu :__ `(Ad) is that yonder, far from speaker and listener.`

## Specificity

By default, individual particles can be anything in the universe that satisfies
the predicates they are used with. __mai__ and __mao__ can be used to restrict
them to specific individuals the speaker have in mind :

- __mai :__ `(Ad) is indefinite specific.` The listener is not expected to know
  which one.
- __mao :__ `(Ad) is definite specific.` The listener is expected to know which
  one from context.

__ma__ have definition `(Ac) is not bound outside of this scope.` It can be
used in definitions to define "default values" and its usage will be more
details in a later chapter.
