# Text structure

An eberban text is organized as a list of paragraphs, which are themselves
a list of either __sentences__ or __definitions__.

The start of a paragraph is marked with the particle family __PU__, containing
all particles starting with __pu__. While __pu__ indicates a new paragraph, a
change of topic, the particles __pua, pue, pui__ and __puo__ indicates
increasingly large changes of topic, similar to subsections, sections, chapters,
etc. The marker of the first paragraph of a text is optional, and if missing
is infered to be __pu__.

The start of a sentence is marked with the particle family __PA__, containing
all particles starting with __pa__ expect __pai__ which is in its own __PAI__
family. __PA__ contains these members :

- __pa :__ assertive sentence, that can be believed or disbelived, and is either
  true or false.
- __pae :__ vocative sentence, defines the listener as the first variable of the
  scope.
- __pao :__ declarative sentence, that is true only because uttered (used for
  declarations, announcements, etc)
- __pau :__ directive sentence, that is requested, wished or ordered to be true.

> With __pae__ it is possible to choose a variable which is not the first of
> the sentence. This will be explained in a later chapter.

The marker of the first sentence of a paragraph is optional, and if missing
is infered to be __pa__. Sentences are also optionally terminated by __PAI__,
which is almost always elided.

Definitions are started by the particle family __PO__, containing all particles
starting with __po__, except __poi__ which is in its own __POI__ family and
act an elidable terminator for definitions. Definitions will be explained in
details in a later chapter.
