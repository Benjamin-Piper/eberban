# Quotes

__ca__ (__CA__ family) allow quoting any grammatical eberban text, and is
terminated by __cai__ (__CAI__). This text can itself contain inner __ca__
quotes as __cai__ will match its opeing __ca__. The quote acts as a predicate
with definition `(Ad) is text [text].`

__ce__ (__CE__) allows quoting a single eberban word (particle, root, borrowing,
compound), ignoring its grammar. It has definition `(Ad) is word [word].`

__cei__ will insead express the family of the word.

- __ce fe__ : `(Ad) is the word "fe".`
- __cei fe__ : `(Ad) is word family FA.`
- __ce spi__: `(Ad) is the word "spi".`
- __cei spi__: `(Ad) is a root word.`

__co__ (__CO__) allows to quote anything such as foreign text, ungrammatical
eberban text or even arbitrary data. __co__ is followed by a single arbitrary
root or particle, which has the role of a delimiter (it must no necessary be 
an existing particle or root, only a valid form). The quote ends when this
word appear again with at least one space before it in written media, and with
a pause before it in speech. The delimiter word should not appear in the text,
either written with same ltters or pronounced the same way, as it could lead to
ambiguities regarding where the quote ends. This block acts as a predicate
with definition `(Ad) is foreign text/arbitrary data [content].`

As the content may be unreadable for the speaker, he is free to pronounce
only the enclosing delimiter while skipping the content. Foreign quotes are
the canonical way to embed things such as images or URLs into eberban text.
It is recommended however to provide a description in eberban to help
comprehension for all speakers, listeners or readers.
