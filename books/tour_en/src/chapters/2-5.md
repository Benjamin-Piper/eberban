# Borrowings

Borrowings allows to import words from other languages which would be difficult
or even impossible to translate using root words, such as proper names,
names of species, and some cultural concepts eberban avoids to include
in its roots to be more culturaly neutral.

A borrowing starts with the letter __u__, followed by the borrowed word writen
in the phonology and morphology allowed by eberban while trying to stay
close to the original pronounciation.

If the borrowed word start with __u__ then the prefix is __u'__ to avoid
2 consecutive _u_.

A chain of multiple borrowings will count as only one predicate composed of
multiple parts. To prevent 2 borrowings to fuse into one predicate, you can
separate them with the particle __be__ (__be__ can optionaly appear after
every borrowing group but is only necessary when separating multiple groups).

Their definition is `(Ed) is a [borrowed word].`. Having a generic place
structure makes comprehension easier form a listener or reader who might not
be familiar with the borrowed word.

The borrowing can be prefixed by the particle __za__ to transform it into
a proper name with definition `(Ec) is named [borrowed word]`. A more complete
explanation of __za__ will be provided in a later chapter.

## Example

- tsen: `(Ec) invents/creates/authors [Ad].`

``gloss
za umia uentropi tsen eberban

{za umia uentropi} tsen eberban

{\[__X__ is named "mia entropi"\]} {\[__X__ creates __Y__\]} {\[__Y__ is eberban\]}

"mia entropi" creates eberban.
