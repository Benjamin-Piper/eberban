# Proposition and predicates

eberban grammar is based around __Second-Order Logic (SOL)__ and tries to stay
pretty close to it while still being easy to use by humans.

Let's first start with some english sentences such as :

- "A cat sleeps."
- "You eat an apple."

These are statement about something being true (or false), and are called
__propositions__, which are made of a __subject__ ("A cat"/"You") and a __verbal
clause__ ("sleeps"/"eat an apple"), itself being composed of a __verb__
("sleeps"/"eat") and optionally one or more __objects__ (none/"an apple"). The
__verb__ is describing something about the __subject__ and __objects__.

In eberban the equivalent of a __verb__ is called a __predicate__, which can be
seen as a __proposition__ template with open blanks for the things it describes.
The verb "eat" could thus be expressed as a __predicate__ as `_ is eating _`,
the first blank `_` representing what/who is eating, while the second blank
represents what is being eaten. The second __verb__ can be expressed similarly
as `_ is sleeping`. These blanks are called __places__.

To get closer to eberban sentences, we need to do a small trick with the subject
and objects. Indeed, "a cat" is pretty much equivalent to "something which is a
cat", "you" to "something which is you", etc. With that form we can see that
those subjects call also by expressed using __predicates__ such as `_ is a cat`,
and say that :

- \[__something-1__ is a cat\] AND \[__something-1__ sleeps\]
- \[__something-2__ is me\] AND \[__something-2__ eats __something-3__\] AND
  \[__something-3__ is an apple\]

These "__somethings__" are called __individual variables__ and are managed by
the eberban grammar, and we'll write them in glosses as letters such as __X__
or __Y__ to keep things short.

Definitions of eberban __predicate words__ are like this :

- mlian: `(A) is a cat.`
- minu : `(A) sleeps.`

`(A)` represents an __place__. The letter in parenthesis can be either
**A, E, I** or **O**, and allow to identify it when using some particles.
When multiple __predicate words__ are chained one after the other, their **A**
place are the same thing, while any other place will have its own
__individual variable__.

``gloss
mlian minu

cat sleeps

{\[__X__ is a cat\]} {\[__X__ sleeps\]} 

A cat sleeps.
``

Here are the definitions to translate the other sentence :

- mo : `(A) is you, a listener.`
- bouri : `(A) eats [E].`
- menoe : `(A) is an apple.`

Here __bouri__ has an `E` place in brackets. Predicates having an `[E]` place
are called __switch predicates__ as they switch which __individual variable__
is carried on to the next predicate.

``gloss
mo bouri menoe

you eats apple

{\[__X__ is you\]} {\[__X__ eats __Y__\]} {\[__Y__ is an apple\]}

You eat an apple.
``

> Note : some predicates have an `(E)` place instead of `[E]` and are
> not __switch predicates__. This is often used when places besides `(A)` are
> not very important, and carrying the __A__ place __individual variable__ is
> more usefull.

Multiple __switch predicates__ can be used in the same sentence :

- mi : `(A) is I/me/a speaker/author.`
- viru : `(A) sees [E].`
- bri : `(A) (default: here) is above/upward/up from [E] (default: here).`
- kcaro : `(A) is a table.`

``gloss
mi viru menoe bri kcaro

me sees apple above table

{\[__X__ is me\]} {\[__X__ sees __Y__\]} {\[__Y__ is an apple\]}
{\[__Y__ is above __Z__\]} {\[__Z__ is a table\]}

I see an apple on a table.
``

> Note : Some predicates like _bri_ specifies a __default__ value. This value is used when
> its __individual variable__ is not shared with another predicate in the
> sentence.
