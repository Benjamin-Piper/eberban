# Text structure

An eberban text is organized as a list of paragraphs, which are themselves
lists of either __sentences__ or __definitions__.

## Paragraphs

The start of a paragraph is marked with the particle family __PU__, containing
all particles starting with __pu__. While __pu__ indicates a new paragraph (a
change of topic), the particles __pua, pue, pui__ and __puo__ indicate
increasingly large changes of topic, similar to subsections, sections, chapters,
etc. The marker of the first paragraph of a text is optional, and if missing
is infered to be __pu__.

## Sentences

The start of a sentence is marked with the particle family __PA__, containing
all particles starting with __pa__. __PA__ contains these members :

- __pa :__ assertive sentence, that can be believed or disbelived, and is either
  true or false.
- __pai :__ declarative sentence, that is true only because it is uttered (used
  for declarations, announcements, etc)
- __pau :__ directive sentence, that is requested, wished or ordered to be true.
- __paho :__ vocative sentence, defines the listener as the first variable of the
  scope.

> With __paho__ it is possible to choose a variable which is not the first
> variable of the sentence. This will be explained in a later chapter.

The marker of the first sentence of a paragraph is optional, and if missing
is inferred to be __pa__.

starting with __po__. Definitions will be explained in detail in a later
chapter.
