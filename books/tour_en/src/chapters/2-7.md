# Compounds

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical. Complex
concepts are often built upon multiple more primitive concepts, and compounds
are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow transforming any string of valid eberban words (particles, roots
, borrowings, and even other compounds) into a single unit, __ignoring
their grammatical rules__ but keeping (to a certain extent) their meaning.

A compound is first prefixed by the letter __e, i, o__, respectively starting a
compound composed of 2, 3, or 4 words. Spaces can be inserted between
any parts of the compound. Longer compounds can be created by nesting multiple
compounds.

If the first word starts with a vowel (a borrowing or another inner nested
compound) then the pause before this vowel is optional.

A compound have a __unique, fixed meaning which is defined in the dictionary__,
and while its definition can be arbitrary, it usually provides places taken
from its individual components. Usually the most important word is the rightmost
one, and additional words are added to the left to help narrow down the meaning,
yielding greater precision.

It is common to lexicalize a borrowing by making a compound with it. Cultural
concepts are borrowed with endonyms, sounding similar to the original word.

> __e ber ban :__ `(Ad) is the eberban language.`
> 
> - ber : `(Ad) reflects this language (eberban).`
> - ban : `(Ad) is expressed in language [Ed].`

> __e ufranse ban :__ `(Ad) is the french language.`
> 
> - ufranse : borrowing of "french" ("franÃ§ais" in french).
> - ban : `(Ad) is expressed in language [Ed].`

> __i cen po bu :__ `(Ad) is a dictionary.`
>
> - cen : `(Ad) is a word.`
> - po : Particle starting a definition.
> - bu : Particle allowing to create lists.
